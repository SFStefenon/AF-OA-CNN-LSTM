# Adaptive filter optimized attention-based CNN-LSTM

This repository presents an adaptive filter optimized attention-based CNN-LSTM (AF-OA-CNN-LSTM) model hypertunded by an adaptive tree-structured Parzen estimator (ATPE).
The proposed AF-OA-CNN-LSTM considers an evaluation of random search, annealing search, TPE, and ATPE to model hyperparameter tuning.

The model is compared to TiDE, NHITS, N-BEATS, NBEATSx, DilatedRNN, LSTM, GRU, DeepAR, TFT, Informer, PatchTST, FEDformer, TCN, BiTCN, TimesNet deep learning structures. 
For denoising, the SMA, STL, EMA, SG, HP, Butterworth, Gaussian, Median, Wiener, Kalman, and Wavelet filters are compared.
The complete pipeline of the analysis of the proposed method is presented below:
