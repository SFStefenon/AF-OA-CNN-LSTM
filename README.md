# Optimized adaptive input filtering attention-based CNN-LSTM model

This repository presents an attention-based CNN-LSTM model optimized by an adaptive tree-structured Parzen estimator (ATPE) with an adaptive filtered input stage.
The proposed algorithm considers an evaluation of random search, annealing search, TPE, and ATPE to model hyperparameter tuning.

The model is compared to TiDE, NHITS, N-BEATS, NBEATSx, DilatedRNN, LSTM, GRU, DeepAR, TFT, Informer, PatchTST, FEDformer, TCN, BiTCN, TimesNet deep learning structures. 
The SMA, STL, EMA, SG, HP, Butterworth, Gaussian, Median, Wiener, Kalman, and Wavelet filters are compared.
The complete pipeline of the analysis of the proposed method is presented below:
